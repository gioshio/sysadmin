The Nautilus application development team recently finished the beta version 
of one of their Java-based applications, which they are planning to deploy on
 one of the app servers in Stratos DC. After an internal team meeting, they 
 have decided to use the tomcat application server. Based on the requirements 
 mentioned below complete the task:


a. Install tomcat server on App Server 3 using yum.

b. Configure it to run on port 5002.

c. There is a ROOT.war file on Jump host at location /tmp. Deploy it on this 
tomcat server and make sure the webpage works directly on base URL i.e without 
specifying any sub-directory anything like this http://URL/ROOT .

d. You can access the website on LBR link. To do so click on the + button on 
top of your terminal, select option Select port to view on Host 1, and after 
adding port 80 click on Display Port.


Solution: 

Copy war file from jump host to desired server mentioned in the question

scp /tmp/ROOT.war tony@stapp01:/tmp

Login to mentioned server as a root

ssh tony@stapp01

sudo su

Install tomcat server

sudo yum install tomcat

Then copy war file to tomcat server

cp /tmp/ROOT.war /usr/share/tomcat/webapps

Open the config file of tomcat server and replace the port by mentioned port

vi /usr/share/tomcat/conf/server.xml

 <Connector port="5002" protocol="HTTP/1.1"

               connectionTimeout="20000"

               redirectPort="8443" />
Save it and restart server

sudo systemctl start tomcat

sudo systemctl status tomcat

sudo systemctl enable tomcat
