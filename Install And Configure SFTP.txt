Some of the developers from Nautilus project team have asked for SFTP
access to at least one of the app server in Stratos DC. After going 
through the requirements, the system admins team has decided to configure
the SFTP server on App Server 3 server in Stratos Datacenter. 
Please configure it as per the following instructions:


a. Create an SFTP user james and set its password to YchZHRcLkL.

b. Password authentication should be enabled for this user.

c. Set its ChrootDirectory to /var/www/webapp.

d. SFTP user should only be allowed to make SFTP connections.


Solution: Login to mentioned server in question

ssh banner@stapp03

Then Login as root

sudo su

Then add user and password

useradd james

passwd james

Next create mentioned directory and make the new user owner of that directory

mkdir -p /var/www/webapp

chown james:james /var/www/webapp

Also make root as the owner  and take permissions

chown root:root /var/www
chmod -R 755 /var/www
chmod -R 755 /var/www/webapp
chown -R james /var/www/webapp
chown -R root /var/www/webapp
chown -R root /var/www/
chmod -R 755 /var/www/

Now  edit the sshd_config file as follows

vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config

Match User james
ForceCommand internal-sftp
PasswordAuthentication yes
ChrootDirectory /var/www/webapp
PermitTunnel no
AllowAgentForwarding no
AllowTcpForwarding no
X11Forwarding no

systemctl restart sshd

sftp james@localhost

ssh james@stapp03
