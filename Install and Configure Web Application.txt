Solution:

Login to every appserver by ssh

ssh tony@stapp01  Ir0nM@n
ssh steve@stapp02  Am3ric@
ssh banner@stapp03 BigGr33n

Then login as root

sudo su

Install httpd and openssh in all appservers

yum install httpd -y
yum install openssh-clients -y
systemctl restart sshd

Copy mentioned folders in the question  to every appserver from jump host

scp -r /home/thor/ecommerce tony@stapp01:/tmp
scp -r /home/thor/games tony@stapp01:/tmp

scp -r /home/thor/official steve@stapp02:/tmp
scp -r /home/thor/apps steve@stapp02:/tmp

scp -r /home/thor/official banner@stapp03:/tmp
scp -r /home/thor/apps banner@stapp03:/tmp

Then from any appserver move the folders to server html folder

mv /tmp/ecommerce /var/www/html
mv /tmp/games /var/www/html

Next change Listen port to 8080 and restart httpd in all appservers

vi /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf

systemctl start httpd
systemctl enable httpd

Check from jump host

curl http://stapp01:8080/official/

curl http://stapp01:8080/apps/

curl http://stapp02:8080/official/

curl http://stapp02:8080/apps/

curl http://stapp03:8080/official/

curl http://stapp03:8080/apps/
